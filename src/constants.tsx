export const FAQ_DATA = [
    {
        question: "What is the average cost of a rooftop solar system?",
        answer: "The cost varies depending on the system size. For a typical 3 kW system, the cost is around ₹1,80,000 to ₹2,10,000. However, with the PM Surya Ghar subsidy of ₹78,000, the net cost to the customer is significantly lower. We also offer flexible EMI and loan options."
    },
    {
        question: "How much can I save on my electricity bills?",
        answer: "With a properly sized system, you can reduce your electricity bills to zero. Any surplus energy generated is exported to the grid, and you get credits for it, further reducing or eliminating your bill. On average, a 1 kW system saves you about ₹1,000 per month."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the PM-KUSUM subsidy for solar pumps work?",
        answer: "Under PM-KUSUM, farmers typically receive a total subsidy of 60% (30% from the Central Government and 30% from the State Government). You only need to pay 40% of the cost, and bank loans are available for up to 30% of the total cost, meaning your upfront contribution can be as low as 10%."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does the installation process take?",
        answer: "For a residential rooftop system, the physical installation usually takes only 2-3 days. The complete process, including subsidy application, DISCOM approval, and net meter installation, can take between 45 to 120 days. Our team handles all the paperwork to ensure a smooth process for you."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the lifespan of a solar panel system?",
        answer: "Our Tier-1 solar panels come with a 25-year performance warranty. The panels can continue to produce power for 30 years or more. The inverter typically has a warranty of 5-10 years and might need replacement once during the system's lifetime."
